# Superfluid Conviction Voting Tool
# Introduction

This work provides a generic conviction voting tool, powered by superfluid framework, to enable the easy adoption of conviction voting . More importantly, our conviction voting implementation can automatically react to any constant Superfluid streaming changes. In other words, user can continuously increase/decrease their conviction voting power towards their favourite proposals while they are sending/receiving the governance tokens without extra transaction, lockup and staking.
