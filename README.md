# Superfluid Conviction Voting with Constant Flow Streaming Support

This hackathon work provides a generic conviction voting tool, powered by superfluid framework, to enable the easy adoption of conviction voting. 

Our conviction voting implementation can automatically react to any constant Superfluid streaming changes. In other words, user can continuously increase/decrease their conviction voting power towards their favourite proposals while they are sending/receiving the governance tokens without extra transaction, lockup and staking.
